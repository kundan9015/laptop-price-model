# Laptop Price Prediction using Polynomial Regression

This project demonstrates **polynomial regression** for predicting laptop prices based on CPU frequency.  
It focuses on understanding **non-linear relationships**, **overfitting behavior**, and **model evaluation** using standard regression metrics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Implemented **Polynomial Regression** using both:
  - NumPy (`polyfit`, `poly1d`)
  - scikit-learn (`PolynomialFeatures`, `LinearRegression`)
- Compared different polynomial degrees
- Analyzed **overfitting and extrapolation issues**
- Evaluated model performance using **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Feature (X):** CPU Frequency  
- **Target (y):** Laptop Price  

The dataset is used to study how price changes with CPU frequency and how polynomial degree impacts prediction stability.
